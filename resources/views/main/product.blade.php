        <h1 class="text-sm text-slate-500 ml-3 mb-5 max-w-xl">Plywood Pallets are quite strong even though they weigh
            very small, are lightweight, perfect for shipping and transportation, minimal moisture absorption. Plywood
            has a smooth, clean surface and is suitable for rack stocking/layer stacking.

        <h1 class="text-sm text-slate-500 ml-3 mb-5 max-w-xl">Heavy-duty corrugated packaging is designed to give
            extreme levels of protection in transit and is often used for heavy, fragile, bulky, or high-value products.
            Predominantly made from double or triple wall corrugated board, heavy-duty packaging can also incorporate a
            range of additional materials to support the supply chain requirements including foam, plastics,
            polystyrene, plywood, and timber.</h1>

            products safe. It is also light and can be crumpled. It shows high reliability with both its high pressure
            and bursting level, as well as its moisture resistance and sealing performance.</h1>

        <h1 class="text-sm text-slate-500 ml-3 mb-5 max-w-xl">A wooden box is a container made of wood for storage or as
            a shipping container. The strength of a wooden box is rated based on the weight it can carry before the cap
            (top, ends, and sides) is installed. Performance is strongly influenced by the specific design, type of
            wood, type of fasteners (nails, etc.), workmanship. Talk to us to discuss your specification and
            requirement.</h1>
